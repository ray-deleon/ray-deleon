### 👨‍💻 About Me
Bilingual IT professional with 8+ years of experience spanning software engineering, cloud, cybersecurity, data analytics, and IT support. I specialize in building secure, scalable, and data-driven solutions, with hands-on experience across AWS, DevSecOps, and incident-aware development.

I’ve worked across banking, telecom, government, retail, and SaaS environments in both the U.S. and Dominican Republic, and I’m currently focused on cloud security engineering, threat detection, and automation.

I’m known for:

Translating complex technical problems into clear solutions

Applying security-by-design and OWASP principles

Continuous learning and practical experimentation
